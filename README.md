## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. User fills out the form fields.  
2. JavaScript checks:
   - Name field is not empty.  
   - Email format is valid.  
   - Password field is not empty.  
   - One language is selected.  
   - Terms and Conditions are accepted.  
3. If any field is invalid, an **error message** appears using Bootstrap’s `invalid-feedback` class.  
4. When valid, the form can be submitted successfully.
